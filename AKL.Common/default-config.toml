# **switch_key**:
# 
# Sets the key which should activate the virtual layer so that your mappings are
# actually invoked when you press the specified target key combination.
#
# Following resource lists all possible named keys without the "VK" prefix.

#
# This program differentiates between "key" and "key combination" by wether a 
# single key or multiple distinct keys on the keyboard are pressed. For example
# "Shift+s" wouldn't be a valid switch-key.
#
# Warning: It also only deals with raw keys (additionally to named keys such as
# "Ctrl", "Shift", "F1", etc.) which means a key combination that is defined
# with characters that require multiple keys to be pressed at the same time
# won't be recognized at all. An example would be "$" which you get by pressing
# "Shift+4" on most keyboard layouts. This likewise applies to all upper case
# letters (e. g "A", "B", "Ä", "Ö", etc.).
#
# There is no way for this application to inherently disallow specific
# characters such as "$" in a key combination while also staying compatible with
# most existing keyboard layouts.
switch_key = "CapsLock"

# **default_simulation_combination**:
#
# This key combination will be simulated if you press and release the switch key
# without invoking any mappings.
# 
# Note that each key combination can't be longer than four keys.
#
# Can be disabled by setting it to "".
default_simulation_combination = "Escape"

# **start_with_the_system**:
#
# Autostart with the operating system
#
# Only supported on windows because of the big amount of different things that
# can be done on unix systems to autostart and not wanting to impose a specific
# solution on the users.
start_with_system = "False"

# **mappings**:
#
# All mappings are defined as "target key combination" and "replacement key
# combination". See **switch_key** for the details about key combinations.
#
# Note: All target key combinations are additional to your switch key.
